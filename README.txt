HOW TO START:
To start this application, make sure you are in the directory as rockPaperScissors.html and run 'start rockPaperScissors.html'

Rock, Paper, Scissors:
This app allows a player to play rock paper scissors. They select a hand, click let's play (if no hand was selected, one will
be picked for the player). The player can change their selection during the countdown. The game then displays the PC's choice, and
prompts the user if they won or loss. It then increments the score accordingly. This app is also responsive to screen size.

**The user can continue to click a different hand after the let's play button is pressed, and then it will compare the last hand selected
when the timer completes. Ideally, I think I'd prefer the user to be unable to click the listener while the timer is running, 
but I am still trying to implement this feature. **
***BUG: The hover only works initially, but then when a hand icon is clicked,the hover goes away and a
user has to click again for their selections to begin being processed.***
